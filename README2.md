# Interview proces
Interview proces consists of few steps that are described below: 

## 1. Initial contact with our HR 
If you are seeing this page that means you already talked with our HR department and you successfully completed the first step - Hooray üëè

## 2. Implementation of the simple Project task 
We want to see you in action üíª. We have defined simple [ToDo application](./README.md#Project-task) that you need to develop. This app will not take too much time for your to develop it, but it will help us to evaluate your skills and your abilities. This app is intro to the last 3rd step. 

## 3. Final interview with our engineers
In this step you will talk directly with our engineers. 

First thing that we expect from you is to present the app you have developed in previous step. You can expect some questions about implementation details (for example why did you decide to implement the app that way you did and are there any ways to improve it).

Beside questions about the application you can expect some general questions about:

* Web Technologies (for example what is HTTP, what is REST etc.)
* Databases
* Small and simple coding task (for example sort array of `N` numbers)
     
**Important:** The questions above are not going to be binary questions (Yes/No). If you don't know the answer we will try to help you to see how do you think. This will also help us to understand what is the best project you might work on. Also, these questions are NOT eliminatory questions!

## 4. Decision
Few days after 3rd step we will let you know about our final decision üèÅ.
